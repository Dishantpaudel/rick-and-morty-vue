## Overview
This single-page application consumes the Rick and Morty API and focuses on a clean UX with fast navigation, resilient loading/error handling, and maintainable component architecture.

## Features
- Hash-based route system with dedicated pages for:
  - `#/` (character explorer)
  - `#/about`
  - `#/character/:id` (detail view)
- Search with debounced input for smoother API traffic
- Status filtering (`Alive`, `Dead`, `Unknown`) and pagination controls
- Character detail page with origin, location, type, and episode count
- Skeleton loading UI and retry actions for failed requests
- Empty-state experience for no-match searches
- Storybook stories for reusable UI components
- Unit/component tests with Vitest + Vue Test Utils
- End-to-end tests with Playwright (API responses mocked for stable test runs)

## Tech Stack
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
